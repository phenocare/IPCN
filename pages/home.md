The ongoing COVID-19 pandemics calls for a broad and coordinated response from the scientific community, to produce vaccine to protect us, but also to improve screening and early detection, follow and predict severity, and monitor recovery and long term effects.   

A worldwide international COVID Research Network consisting of several institutions has been setup in April 2020. It was initiated by Bruker and is chaired by Prof. Jeremy Nicholson who run the Australian National Phenome Center (ANPC).

This network aims at harnessing the power of standardized analytical procedures to build a fully exchangeable and integratable data bank across its collaborators.
